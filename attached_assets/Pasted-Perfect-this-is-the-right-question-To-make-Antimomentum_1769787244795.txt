Perfect — this is the right question.
To make Antimomentum work autonomously like Replit Agent 3, you need a tool-first agent architecture where the LLM plans and decides, and tools execute.

Below is a clear, production-ready blueprint for adding many tools and letting the agent run autonomously.


---

🧠 Antimomentum Autonomous Agent — Tool System

Core principle

> LLM = Brain
Tools = Hands
Planner = Manager
Validator = QA



The agent must not just answer — it must:

Plan

Choose tools

Execute steps

Observe results

Fix mistakes

Finalize deliverables



---

1️⃣ Tool Categories (You NEED these)

📂 File & Document Tools

Used for all office work.

Tool	Purpose

read_pdf	Extract text, tables
read_docx	Read Word docs
read_xlsx	Read Excel
write_docx	Create Word files
write_pdf	Create PDFs
write_pptx	Create presentations
write_xlsx	Create spreadsheets


📌 These tools are non-negotiable.


---

🔍 Research & Knowledge Tools

Tool	Purpose

web_search	Find info
fetch_url	Read webpages
citation_builder	Create citations
fact_checker	Verify claims



---

📊 Data & Accounting Tools

Tool	Purpose

analyze_csv	Data analysis
calculate_finance	Budgets, P&L
generate_chart	Graphs
validate_numbers	Error checking



---

🧠 Thinking & Structuring Tools

Tool	Purpose

outline_generator	Structured docs
mindmap_generator	Concept maps
summarize_content	Key points
rewrite_text	Improve clarity



---

🧪 Agent Control Tools (Critical)

Tool	Purpose

create_plan	Step-by-step plan
run_step	Execute task
review_output	QA
revise_output	Fix mistakes
finalize_project	Deliver



---

2️⃣ Tool Interface (Standardized)

Every tool should follow one strict interface:

{
  "name": "tool_name",
  "description": "What this tool does",
  "inputs": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "input": { "type": "string" }
    }
  },
  "output": "string or file reference"
}

Consistency = autonomy.

3️⃣ Planner → Tool Router → Executor Flow

🔄 Autonomous Loop

User Prompt
   ↓
Planner Agent (LLM)
   ↓
Task Plan (Steps)
   ↓
Tool Router
   ↓
Execution Tools
   ↓
Result Observer
   ↓
Validator Agent
   ↓
Fix or Continue
   ↓
Final Output

4️⃣ Example Autonomous Execution (Realistic)

User:

> “Create a quarterly business report and slides from this Excel file.”



Agent:

1. Planner creates steps


2. Tool Router assigns:

read_xlsx

analyze_csv

outline_generator

write_docx

write_pptx



3. Execution


4. Validator checks totals & wording


5. Final deliverables



User only sees: ✅ Progress
✅ Files
✅ Results


---

5️⃣ System Prompt (THIS IS CRITICAL)

Use this for your main agent:

You are Antimomentum, an autonomous AI agent.
You do not stop at explanations.
You plan, execute, review, and finalize tasks.

You must:
1. Create a step-by-step plan
2. Choose appropriate tools
3. Execute each step autonomously
4. Observe tool outputs
5. Fix mistakes if detected
6. Deliver professional files

If a tool fails, retry or choose an alternative.
Do not ask the user unless absolutely necessary.


---

6️⃣ Tool Routing Logic (Simple Version)

def route_tool(step):
    if "pdf" in step:
        return read_pdf
    if "excel" in step:
        return read_xlsx
    if "presentation" in step:
        return write_pptx

Later → replace with LLM-based routing.


---

7️⃣ Memory (Required for Autonomy)

Your agent must store:

Task history

Step results

File paths

User preferences

Writing style


Use:

Vector DB (for context)

JSON state store (for steps)



---

8️⃣ Safety & Control

Dry-run mode

Approval checkpoints

Cost limits

Rollback

Step cancellation


This is what makes it enterprise-ready.


---

9️⃣ MVP Tool Stack (Start Small)

Start with 10 tools max:

read_pdf

read_xlsx

write_docx

write_pptx

analyze_csv

outline_generator

summarize_content

web_search

review_output

finalize_project


Then expand.

🔥 This is HOW Replit Agent Works

Replit Agent:

Plans

Chooses tools

Executes autonomously

Observes failures

Fixes itself


You’re building the same class of system, just for office + research.
